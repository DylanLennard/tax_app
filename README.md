# Tax App  
The purpose of this app is to explore concepts in Java and OOP, both of which I am
relatively new to. If you've ever thought to yourself "What would be my take
home pay after taxes if I made x per year," you're in luck!

### What does it do  
This currently is a command line interactive program which asks the user for
their annual pre-tax income and returns their income after taxes. At the moment
it assumes the user is single and in California, however I hope to eventually
expand this to be able to calculate the rates for any state and for married
couples as well. 

### What it does not do  
Replace turbotax.
